Agency Wedding Site
====================

## How to Customize
These instructions are extremely brief and assume some familiarity with Jekyll and GitHub pages. For more specific help or questions, find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/craigeley) or submit a pull request.

### The Weekend

The icons for this section can be anything from the [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) collection.

### The Couple 

These pictures are in `img/team`, and the social media accounts are set in the `_config.yml` file.

### Timeline

This is simply an embedded [Timeline.js](http://timeline3.knightlab.com/) timeline. See the instructions over at their site.

### Gallery

These images are in `img/gallery`. This gallery is a [Clearing Lightbox](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/clearing.html).
