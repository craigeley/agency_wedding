Agency Wedding Site
====================

This is the source code for a wedding website I built based on the [Jekyll Agency Theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme). These are some very brief customization instructions that assume some familiarity with Jekyll. For more specific help or questions, find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/craigeley) or submit a pull request.

### The Couple 

These pictures are in `img/team`, and the social media accounts and links are set in the `_config.yml` file.

### The Weekend

The icons for this section can be anything from the [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) collection.[^1510262317]

### Timeline

This is an embedded [Timeline.js](http://timeline3.knightlab.com/) timeline which pulls data from a Google sheet. See the instructions over at their site.

### Gallery

These images are in `img/gallery`. This gallery is a [Clearing Lightbox](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/clearing.html).
