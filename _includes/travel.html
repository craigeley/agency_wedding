				<p class="text-white"><a href="http://nysparks.com/parks/79/details.aspx">Letchworth State Park</a> is a beautiful place to explore. There are over 66 miles of hiking trails, lots of scenic views, and a great swimming pool. You&#8217;ll need a visitor&#8217;s pass for every car that enters the park, but don&#8217;t worry—there&#8217;ll be one in your invitation. If nature isn&#8217;t your thing, there&#8217;s pizza and mini golf just up the road at the <a href="http://charcoalcorral.com/wp2014/">Charcoal Corral</a>.</p>

				<h4 class="service-heading text-center text-white">Travel</h4>

				<p class="text-white">The park is around a 4 hour drive from Canton, NY and Pittsburgh, and it&#8217;s about 5 hours from New York City and Baltimore. If you&#8217;re flying, we recommend either the Rochester (ROC) or Buffalo (BUF) airports, both of which are an hour’s drive from the park.</p>

				<h4 class="service-heading text-center text-white">Sleep</h4>

				<p class="text-white">There are two primary hotels for the wedding. The <a href="http://www.countryinns.com/mt-morris-hotel-ny-14510/nymtmorr">Country Inn &amp; Suites in Mt. Morris, NY</a> has very limited availability. There is a block of rooms available at the <a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/hampton-inn-geneseo-ROCGEHX/index.html">Hampton Inn in Geneseo, NY</a>. Be sure to mention that you are with the Eley/Wyckoff wedding.</p>

				<p class="text-white">We also have reserved the <a href="http://www.allegiancebandb.com/rooms.html">Allegiance Bed &amp; Breakfast in Mt. Morris, NY</a>. The entire B&amp;B is set aside for wedding guests this weekend, but again, please ask for the Eley/Wyckoff rate.</p>
