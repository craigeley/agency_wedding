### Visiting

[Letchworth State Park](http://nysparks.com/parks/79/details.aspx) is a beautiful place to explore. There are over 66 miles of hiking trails, lots of scenic views, and a great swimming pool. You'll need a visitor's pass for every car that enters the park, but don't worry—there'll be one in your invitation. If nature isn't your thing, there's pizza and mini golf just up the road at the [Charcoal Corral](http://charcoalcorral.com/wp2014/).

### Travel

The park is around a 4 hour drive from Canton, NY and Pittsburgh, and it's about 5 hours from New York City and Baltimore. If you're flying, we recommend either the Rochester (ROC) or Buffalo (BUF) airports, both of which are an hour’s drive from the park.

### Lodging

The main hotel for the wedding is the [Country Inn & Suites in Mt. Morris, NY](http://www.countryinns.com/mt-morris-hotel-ny-14510/nymtmorr). We have reserved a block of rooms—ask for the Eley/Wyckoff wedding rate.

We also have reserved the [Allegiance Bed & Breakfast in Mt. Morris, NY](http://www.allegiancebandb.com/rooms.html). The entire B&B is set aside for wedding guests this weekend, but again, please ask for the Eley/Wyckoff rate.

Finally, if you feel like roughing it, there are some rustic cabins and campsites available inside the park. [Click here](http://www.reserveamerica.com/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NY&parkId=375) for a list of sites and to make reservations.
